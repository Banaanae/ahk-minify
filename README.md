# ahk-minify

An AutoHotKey Minifier/Uglifier wrote in ~~AutoHotKey~~ Javascript

Writing in javascript because debugging ahk regex is a pain, will work on a simulation solution soon

Works using RegEx so it has the added benefit of easily being ported to other languages.

## Usage

1. Download and run the [latest release](https://github.com/Banaanae/ahk-minify/releases/latest)
2. Select which rules you want to apply on the script (you can hover over the checkboxes for more info)
3. Press "Select file and Minify" and follow the prompts.
4. Your file will now be minified! (Unless it isn't, if this does happen make an [issue](https://github.com/Banaanae/ahk-minify/issues))

## Roadmap

* [ ] Finish remaining rules
* [ ] Make online version with github pages
* [ ] Start the cycle of fixing edge cases

## Rule Explanations

TODO Write this with details
